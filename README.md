# Sunshine
A simple weather app that pulls weather data, displays details per day, and allows users to access weather data by zip code

#Usage
You should see on the front page a list of weather details for up to 14 days. Clicking on any list item should take you to a more detailed
page providing more info of weather for that day. There you can share the weather by clicking on the share button on the top right
corner.

In addition, you can click on the "Settings" button (thre vertical buttons) on the top right of the front page to get a menu that
allows you to toggle the location of where you want the weather details to come from. In addition, you can chose to disable or
enable notifications, as well as select the theme of the UX.
